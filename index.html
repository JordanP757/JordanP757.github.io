			<p> Welcome to Kingdom's Fall! This is a college project that started at the beginning of the year. This website has been specifcally made to promote the game and show clips of gameplay, screenshots of development, a walkthrough of the first level and an F&Q.
			</p>

			<p>This website has also been created to show my knowledge of <abbr title="Hyper-text Mark up Langauge">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> with little bits of <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr>. This will be visually shown through the pages of the website, trying to make this as user friendly and be aimed at my target audience.
