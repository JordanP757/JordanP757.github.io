			<p>	Several bad guys from the evil kingdom have taken over a 20 floor castle in the centre of your kingdom! They have taken several of your friends and have already stopped a counter attack from your soldiers and have taken them too! 
			</p>

			<p>Several months into the siege, the military have devised a plan and have asked you to take charge with taking over the castle. You decide that the best course of action is to take the building floor by floor, coming across different obstacles each time. You learn that during the siege, the goblins have built up defences to slow you down or to stop you altogether. You must go floor by floor, your main objective is to knock out all threats and save your friends and soldiers. As you save prisoners and eliminate the threats, you gain money in which you can purchase new weapons and equipment to be more efficient in taking down threats and defences. If you fail to save prisoners you will lose money and if you get hit you then have to start the level again. There is a total of 20 floors and after several amount of floors, new challenges will arise. From barricades to lava pits to electrical barriers which will involve being disabled by a switch. They will also be level that you are against the clock as there is a bomb with a timer, once all threats have been eliminated you must defuse the bomb and then you are clear to rescue the prisoners.
			</p>
			
		
			
			<p>Once you get to the top floor you will fight until you surrender you are unable to win on the 20th floor. To win on the 20th floor you must have saved enough friends from the kingdom, they will come and rescue you themselves. However, if you do not save enough of them and leave them, then they will not make an effort to save you and the game ends in you being kidnapped by the evil kingdom.
			</p>
			
			

			<p>This is going to be a 2D platformer fantasy shooter that will consist of different coloured enemies, indicating how much health and damage then will have. You will start off with a poor bow and arrow and if you are hit by the enemy at least once then you will have to start the level again unless upgrades are purchased later in the game. Saving your friends and soldiers will add towards the good ending while saving the civilian will reward the player in money for upgrades and equipment.
			</p>
			
			

			<p>	They will be at least 20+ friends and soldiers to save in the castle and will require more than half to get the win ending. They will only be several upgrades and equipment available to the player. This will include, more health/armour for the player, higher damage weapons, more health for your friend.
